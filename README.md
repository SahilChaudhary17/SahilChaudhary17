## ðŸ˜„ Fun fact

Did you know that the word "karate" actually means "empty hand" in Japanese? This refers to the fact that karate is a martial art that primarily uses the hands and feet as weapons, as opposed to swords or other weapons that are held in the hand. So, despite its name, karate is not about fighting with empty hands, but rather about developing the strength, speed, and agility of the hands and feet to deliver powerful strikes and blocks.

Thanks for stopping by!
